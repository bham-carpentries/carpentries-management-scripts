PLEASE DO NOT MODIFY THIS CODE WITHOUT CREATING/MODIFYING A CORRESPONDING UNIT-TEST (see *_test.py for the tests for file *.py):
  * For bugs a new regression test must be added before fixing
  * For new features add a feature test that will pass when the feature works.


Requirements
------------

Python 3
Python modules listed in requirements.txt

Setup
-----

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

	git clone $repo_url

Then cd into the directory that creates:

	cd carpentries-management-scripts

Next, create a python 3 virtual environment:

	virtualenv -p python3 venv

Activate the environment:

	source venv/bin/activate

Install the requirements:

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Proceed to 'Usage' to user the scripts.

Usage
-----

1. Copy settings.ini.example to settings.ini and put your settings in there (as it contains credentials, make sure the permissions are such that only you can read it!)
     You may need to create an accesstoken (see settings.ini.example).  To do this, go to your account (N.B. account, not repository) settings, click on "Developer Settings" and then "Personal access tokens".
2. Run the script you wish to use, either with python (e.g. 'python3 <script>.py') or directly (e.g. './<script>.py').

N.B. The .gitignore is already configured to ignore settings.ini and directories called 'virtualenv', 'VirtualEnv' and 'venv', to prevent accidental committal of secrets and virtual environments.

Scripts
-------

freeze.py - Freeze all content repositories referenced by the schedule of a specific course and update that schedule to point to the frozen versions.

Testing
-------

Testing was added retrospectively but by requesting that no changes are made without a test being added/changed I'm hoping for 100% test coverage eventually.

The tests can be run by:

	python -m unittest discover -b -p '*_test.py'
